## How it works (Ambiente Docker)
Clonare la repository localmente ed eseguire i seguenti comandi a riga di comando all'interno del progetto:

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

Questo creerà il container docker, già avviato, il quale si potra accedere 
- alla application Laravel con il seguent link: [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
- all'interfaccia grafica di phpMyAdmin con il seguente link: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
